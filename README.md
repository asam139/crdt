# CRDT: State-based LWW-Element Graph

State-based LWW-Element Graph with test cases.

The graph allows:

* Add a vertex/edge.
* Remove a vertex/edge.
* Check if a vertex is in the graph.
* Query for all vertices connected to a vertex.
* Find any path between two vertices.
* Merge with concurrent changes from other graph/replica.
